# FinalProject-Olinjs
**Samantha Kumaresena, Mac-I Crowell, and Sophia Seitz**

## Project Description
Our project seeks to improve the [Olin College dining hall website](https://olindining.sodexomyway.com/) to make it more usable. Currently it can be difficult to find out what food the dining hall is serving at a given meal or what hours the dining hall is open. We hope to address this by creating a website where the menu at a given meal is the focus, rather than information that students might not be as interested in. 

## Minimum Viable Product
At a bare minimum our app will:

*display the dining hall menu for a date/meal combination (sometime in the future or past) selected by the user. This will be displayed in a way that is easier to use than the current dining hall website.

## Expected Features
Additionally, we plan to:

* Allow users to login to our website so that they can:
	* set certain foods as favorite foods
	* get notifications when those foods are served
* Design with Mobile use in mind
* Set up a development pipeline/process so that we deploy the app before it's due

## Stretch Features
If time allows, we also hope to:
* Implement fun, silly features like:
	* Create a personalized recommendation for a given user about whether they might want to go to Trim instead.
	* Similarly, do a "can you be a vegetarian?" (like is it christmas?) 
	*The Carb to Carb converter (Converts rice/pasta/potatoes to "carbs" on our menu)
* Do some sort of visualization of what meals the dining hall serves, and what meals students like. 
* Allow users to rate/review certain meals

## Avoiding Hiccups
As the end of the semester approaches, we know that we will be getting busier and more stressed. So that there are no "blow-ups" we plan to be open and honest about our feelings and motivations. Additionaly, we want our app to be well-organized, so we plan to create a process for development/deploying our app and stick to it.
